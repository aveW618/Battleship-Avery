# Battleship-Avery
AP CSA Project

There are four grids, two for each player (usually 10 x 10)
One board is where the player arranges ships and records the shots by the opponent
The other board is where the player records their own shots

Organize the ships on the grid only horizontal or vertical
Ships cannot overlap or be place diagonally

Players should not see each others boards

Sizes for the ships: carrier (5), battleship (4), destroyer (3), submarine (3), patrol boat (2)

Each round:
player's take turns to target the opponents square
if a ship is hit, print out "hit", the player who got hit marks their own board with a red peg and announces what ship was hit
The attacking player marks the hit or miss on their own "tracking" or "target" grid (white for miss)

If all ships are sunk, print "Battleship" and opponent wins
